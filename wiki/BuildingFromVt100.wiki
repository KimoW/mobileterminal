#summary Extra steps for building from vt100 branch
#labels Featured

= Introduction =

This procedure is necessary to correct certain omissions and/or flaws in the header files that come with iphone-binutils.  You will probably need to start with the instructions in [Building].

= Details =

== At the Checkout Counter ==
First, check out the code by executing 

{{{
svn co http://svn.googlecode.com/svn/branches/vt100 branches/vt100
}}}


== "Make"ing a Break For It ==

After `cd`'ing to `branches/vt100`, try executing `make`.  You may receive errors.  This is unfortunate.

== `bag.ungetc(cat)` ==

If you have any further problems, please post them under [http://code.google.com/p/mobileterminal/issues/detail?id=36 Issue #36].

Thanks to si...@findsimon.com for helping to identify these build problems.
