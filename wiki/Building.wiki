== Obtaining Source ===

First step is obtaining the source.  This step is the same for any project hosted on google code.

{{{
$ svn checkout http://mobileterminal.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ mobileterminal

This will download the latest sources and put them in the mobileterminal directory.  If you already have the source, then you can obtain the latest version by running the following from the mobileterminal directory:

{{{
$ svn up
}}}

=== Building ===

Execute the following command to build the program from source:

{{{
$ cd mobileterminal
$ make
...
}}}

This should a "Terminal" binary in the current directory.  If you have problems building the source, feel free to [http://code.google.com/p/mobileterminal/issues/list Open an Issue].

The default "Terminal" program can be run on the command line of your iPhone.  In order to run it from the main GUI menu, you build the package and place it in the /Applications folder of your phone.

{{{
$ make package
}}}

The above command creates a "Terminal.app" which should be copied to /Applcations on your iPhone.
