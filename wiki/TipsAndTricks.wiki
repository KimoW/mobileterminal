= Tips =

== Hide the Keyboard ==

Tap once on the screen to hide the keyboard.  Tap once more to bring it back up.

== Control Characters ==

You can send a control-C by pressing the "bullet" key (First press ".?123", then "#+=", then the circle on the middle right), then press the C key.  This can be useful when you want to escape out of a long running program such as ping.

Escape is control-[, which may come in handy with vi.
Tab is control-I (yay tab completion).

== Common unix binaries ==

Get the latest iphone-binkit from http://iphone.natetrue.com which contains lots of useful unix binaries. Also there ssh, apache, python, ruby.  Join #iphone-shell on irc.osx86.hu for more discussion.
