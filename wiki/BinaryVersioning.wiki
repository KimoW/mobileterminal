#summary We need a means of labeling/versioning binary distributions.
#labels Versioning,Build,SVN

= Versioning by SVN Revisions =

We could just build SVN and upload it, tagged with the revision number. This is the easy way out.

= Versioning by Features =

Start at 1.0. Increment 0.1 for every revision with a minor bugfix or feature change. Increment 1.0 for major revisions/feature changes.

We could even do something like label odd numbers (1.0) as frozen, stable releases (only being fixed if bugs arise) and label even numbers (2.0) as the development/testing release.
